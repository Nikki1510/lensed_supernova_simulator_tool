# Simulate lensed supernova light curves with lensedSST

![lensedSST_logo2](https://github.com/Nikki1510/lensed_SN_simulator/assets/23623255/ec2c3841-64a0-4f36-95b1-12efee202b59)


This repository contains code to simulate light curves of lensed supernovae Ia as observed with the Vera C. Rubin Observatory/LSST. It uses the LSST Baseline v3.0 observing strategy and includes microlensing effects from stars in the lens galaxy. <be>

Run src/simulate_lensed_SNIa to simulate lensed type Ia supernovae. The catalogue output for 5,000 doubles, quads and unlensed SNIa is saved in the folder lensed_SN_catalog.
